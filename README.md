#Developer's Bookmarks

My (mostly) web Front-end &amp; Back-end bookmark collection that I collected for years.
Feel free to contribute. Let's make a big database of useful tools!

Disclaimer: I found many tools on my own and many tools from [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
But my collection is also different in many ways

###TODO: 
 - ~~Get bookmarks from old email (paired with Chrome)~~
 - Categorize bookmarks
